# audiosdk

**audiosdk** is a modern Swift framework for macOS 14.4+ that enables programmatic recording of audio output from any running application, using Apple's latest CoreAudio process tap APIs. It is inspired by the advanced patterns in [AudioCap](https://github.com/insidegui/AudioCap), but is designed for easy integration into your own apps and tools.

## ‚ú® Key Benefits

- **Record Any App's Audio**: Capture output from any running process by PID, not just system-wide audio.
- **Modern CoreAudio**: Uses Apple's new process tap APIs (`AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap`), available in macOS 14.4+.
- **No Kernel Extensions**: Pure user-space solution‚Äîno drivers, no hacks, no security prompts.
- **Clean Swift API**: Simple, developer-friendly interface with robust error handling.
- **Automatic Resource Cleanup**: Cleans up orphaned CoreAudio devices/taps on startup.
- **Post-Processing Hooks**: Easily add normalization, transcoding, or notifications after recording.
- **Device Selection**: Record from the default output or any specific output device.

## üöÄ What Does It Do?

- Translates a process PID to a CoreAudio object.
- Creates a process tap and aggregate device for that process.
- Streams audio data to a `.wav` file (or other formats if you wish).
- Lets you select the output device (e.g., built-in speakers, external audio).
- Provides real-time audio analysis hooks (RMS, dB).
- Ensures all CoreAudio resources are cleaned up, even after crashes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- **macOS 14.4 or later** (due to new CoreAudio APIs)
- Swift 5.9+
- Xcode 15+

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

### 1. List Available Output Devices

```swift
let devices = AudioRecorder.listOutputAudioDevices()
for device in devices {
    print("\(device.name) [ID: \(device.id)]")
}
```

### 2. Start Recording

```swift
let recorder = AudioRecorder()
let pid: pid_t = /* target process PID */
let outputURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/output.wav")
let deviceID: Int? = /* e.g. 62, or nil for default */

try recorder.startRecording(pid: pid, outputFile: outputURL, outputDeviceID: deviceID)
```

### 3. Stop Recording

```swift
recorder.stopRecording()
```

### 4. Post-Processing

Optionally, set a closure to run after recording stops:

```swift
recorder.postProcessingHandler = { fileURL in
    print("Post-processing at \(fileURL)")
    // Normalize, transcode, upload, etc.
}
```

## üß© Example: Minimal Command-Line App

```swift
import audiosdk

let devices = AudioRecorder.listOutputAudioDevices()
for device in devices {
    print("\(device.name) [ID: \(device.id)]")
}

let recorder = AudioRecorder()
let pid: pid_t = 12345 // Replace with your target app's PID
let outputURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/Users/yourname/Desktop/recording.wav")
try recorder.startRecording(pid: pid, outputFile: outputURL, outputDeviceID: 62) // Use your device ID

sleep(5)
recorder.stopRecording()
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Limitations

- **macOS 14.4+ only**: The process tap APIs are not available on earlier macOS versions.
- **Permissions**: Your app may need microphone/audio capture permissions.
- **Format**: Default output is `.wav` (uncompressed PCM). You can change this in your app.
- **Process Must Be Running**: The target PID must be valid and producing audio.
